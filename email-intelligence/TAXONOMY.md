# Email Intelligence System — Pre-seeded Taxonomy (Tier 1)

**Status:** Pre-seed taxonomy (enforced)

We pre-seed the system with a Tier-1 taxonomy to ensure *every* cluster of emails is placed into a
real category. There is no “Unknown” bucket (and there should never be).

When a cluster cannot be cleanly categorised, a new taxonomical label must be created rather than
defaulting to “Unknown”.

## Tier-1 Taxonomy (Initial, Enforced)

### 1. Financial

Emails whose primary purpose is to record, request, or confirm a financial transaction or
obligation.

Examples:

- Receipts
- Invoices
- Statements
- Payment confirmations
- Subscription charges
- Tax-related documents

Why this is a top-level category:

- High importance
- Low volume relative to noise
- Often legally or personally significant
- Strong downstream actions (archive, retain, export)

### 2. Commercial & Marketing

Emails whose purpose is to influence purchasing or engagement decisions.

Examples:

- Newsletters
- Promotions
- Product updates
- Event announcements
- Discounts and offers

Important nuance:

- This includes legitimate communications you may still want
- It is not a synonym for “spam”

This category is usually huge and visually dominant — which is exactly what you want to see.

### 3. Work & Professional

Emails related to employment, collaboration, or professional identity.

Examples:

- Internal work email
- Recruiters
- Professional networks
- Project updates
- Client communication

This remains separate from Financial even when money is discussed (e.g. salary slips can still be
Financial).

### 4. Personal & Social

Emails primarily related to personal relationships or identity.

Examples:

- Friends and family
- Clubs
- Community groups
- Education
- Healthcare communications (non-billing)

This is often smaller than people expect — which is a useful insight in itself.

### 5. Account & Identity

Emails whose purpose is to manage access, identity, or account state.

Examples:

- Login alerts
- Password resets
- Security notifications
- Account confirmations
- Terms of service updates

This category is extremely repetitive and clusterable — ideal for this system.

### 6. System & Automated

Emails generated by machines to report state, events, or failures.

Examples:

- GitHub notifications
- CI/CD alerts
- Monitoring systems
- Forum notifications
- SaaS system messages

This is where a lot of high-frequency, low-signal email lives.

## Why there is no “Unknown”

Instead of Unknown:

- If it feels financial → Financial
- If it tries to influence you → Commercial & Marketing
- If it relates to your professional role → Work & Professional
- If it concerns your personal life → Personal & Social
- If it manages access → Account & Identity
- If it reports automated events → System & Automated

This forces the model (and later, you) to commit to a worldview, which is how the system improves.

## Tier-2 Taxonomy (Initial, Preferred)

Tier-2 subcategories are **preferred** (and are supplied to the model) to avoid "pot luck" naming.
They are **evolvable**: when the model encounters a cluster that doesn't fit any existing Tier-2
subcategory, it may propose a new one. The system persists these extensions so future prompts
always include the latest taxonomy.
